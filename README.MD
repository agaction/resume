My resume (linked to online LaTeX editor). 

There are a few versions, all written in LaTex:

* Akhil_Goel_Resume: the regular version of my resume, gives a concise rundown of my relevant experience and projects with considerable depth
* Akhil_Goel_CV: a longer version of my Resume (more like a curriculum vitae), contains everything I've done in the past
